        <h3>OUR EDUCATION MODEL</h3>
        <h1>A MODERN SCHOOL</h1>
        <p>
          We do understand the inevitable fact that as each day passes by, the world is being taken over by technology. It is for this reason that we prefer to incorporate it into our students’ education. We have adopted various learning management systems such as Coolsis, Google Suite for Education, and Zoom.
          <br /><br />
          These software are meant to complement physical classes by offering platforms for teachers to assign homework and tests to the students, as well as enabling the teachers to come up with fun quizzes which help stimulate the students in class.
          <br /><br />
          Parents can track their students’ educational progress as well as their discipline since their academic grades and discipline reports are made available in the systems.
          <br /><br />
          During the COVID 19 pandemic, for instance, many students all over the world were unfortunate to stay away from school since many countries enforced a mandatory lockdown. Our students however were not disadvantaged since it was easy for us to transition to a fully online education model. All our staff are technology savvy and our goal is to make sure that every student is very computer literate by the time they leave this place. They will need that dearly in today’s world.
